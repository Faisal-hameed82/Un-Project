<h2>UN STUDENTS OSLO AT A GLANCE</h2>
    
    <hr class="new1">
<p>Here at UN Student Association Oslo, we are driven by a single goal; to bring attention to important issues that impact our global society and ensure the preservation of the universal human rights for all. We strive to impact the world at large by creating a sustainable world in which there is international solidarity, peace and cooperation. As a student organisation, we primarily reach out to everyone enrolled in higher education in Oslo and its surrounding vicinity, though our events are open for all.

 

Read more about how you can engage with the UN Student Association Oslo under 'About Us' or contact us directly for any queries.

With our organisation’s mission always in mind, we constantly strive to find new strategies for reaching out in order to spread knowledge and awareness about current issues that impact the world. Contact us to learn more about our commitment to spreading awareness through our various events and programmes and find out how you can do the same.</p>

<p>
Last year, the UN Student Association was proud to work with organisations such as Doctors Without Borders, Oslo Peace Centre, SPIRE, Oslo World 2017, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs and the United Nations Association of Norway  to create events that tackled important issues. As an independent student organisation, UNSA Oslo work to highlight issues that are important to us.
